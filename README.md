-   Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout that works on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
-   Dark Mode: Beautiful dark theme for a comfortable user experience in low-light environments, powered by `next-themes`.
-   Comprehensive Admin Dashboard: A dedicated interface for healthcare providers to:
    -   View and manage patient data in a sortable, filterable table.
    -   Track key metrics with statistical cards.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

CareSync is built with a focus on scalability, reusability, and a clean separation of concerns.

### Styling
-   Tailwind CSS with Custom Utilities: We leverage Tailwind's utility-first approach and extend it with custom, reusable classes in `globals.css` using the `@layer` directive. This includes helpers for layout (`.container`), typography (`.header`), and component-specific styles (`.admin-stat`, `.data-table`).
-   shadcn/ui Overrides: To maintain a consistent design language, we apply custom styles to our `shadcn/ui` components. These overrides (`.shad-*`) are centralized in `globals.css` for easy maintenance.

### Form Handling
-   Reusable Components: The `CustomFormField.tsx` and `FileUploader.tsx` components provide generic, reusable building blocks for forms. `CustomFormField` dynamically renders various input controls, while `FileUploader` offers a clean drag-and-drop zone, drastically reducing boilerplate.
-   Centralized Validation: `lib/validation.ts` contains all Zod schemas, providing a single source of truth for strongly-typed, declarative validation rules across the application.
-   Server Actions: Form submissions are handled by Next.js Server Actions, ensuring a seamless user experience without full-page reloads and keeping business logic on the server.
