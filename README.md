## ✨ Overview

CareSync is a web application built with the latest technologies to provide a seamless experience for patients and administrators in managing healthcare appointments. The project focuses on a clean, intuitive user interface and a robust backend to handle patient data securely and efficiently.

The current focus is on building a comprehensive patient onboarding form with reusable and scalable components.

## 🚀 Key Features

-   **Patient Onboarding & Management:** A comprehensive, multi-step form for patient registration.
-   **Custom Form Fields:** A reusable `CustomFormField` component designed to handle various input types, making it easy to extend the form.
-   **Appointment Scheduling:** An intuitive interface for patients to schedule appointments using a date and time picker.
-   **Secure File Uploads:** Functionality for patients to upload medical documents, such as physician's notes or lab results.
-   **Schema-Based Validation:** Uses `Zod` to define a validation schema, ensuring data integrity before submission.
-   **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout that works on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
-   **Dark Mode:** Beautiful dark theme for a comfortable user experience in low-light environments, powered by `next-themes`.
-   **Comprehensive Admin Dashboard:** A dedicated interface for healthcare providers to:
    -   View and manage patient data in a sortable, filterable table.
    -   Track key metrics with statistical cards.
    -   Update appointment statuses with clear visual badges.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Framework:** Next.js 14 (with App Router)
-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Backend:** Appwrite (or your choice of BaaS/backend)
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
-   **UI Components:** shadcn/ui
-   **Form Management:** React Hook Form
-   **Schema Validation:** Zod
-   **Date & Time:** react-datepicker
-   **Phone Input:** react-phone-number-input
-   **Theming:** next-themes
-   **Fonts:** Custom Fonts (`Satoshi`, `Inter`)

## 🏗️ Architecture

CareSync is built with a focus on scalability, reusability, and a clean separation of concerns.

### Styling
-   **Tailwind CSS with Custom Utilities**: We leverage Tailwind's utility-first approach and extend it with custom, reusable classes in `globals.css` using the `@layer` directive. This includes helpers for layout (`.container`), typography (`.header`), and component-specific styles (`.admin-stat`, `.data-table`).
-   **`shadcn/ui` Overrides**: To maintain a consistent design language, we apply custom styles to our `shadcn/ui` components. These overrides (`.shad-*`) are centralized in `globals.css` for easy maintenance.

### Form Handling
-   **Reusable Components**: The `CustomFormField.tsx` component is a generic wrapper that dynamically renders various input controls (text, date pickers, file uploads) based on a `fieldType` prop, drastically reducing boilerplate.
-   **Centralized Validation**: `lib/validation.ts` contains all Zod schemas, providing a single source of truth for strongly-typed, declarative validation rules across the application.
-   **Server Actions**: Form submissions are handled by Next.js Server Actions, ensuring a seamless user experience without full-page reloads and keeping business logic on the server.

## 📦 Getting Started
